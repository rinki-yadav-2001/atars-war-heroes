# Star Wars React App

This project is applications fetches Star Wars characters from the SWAPI (Star Wars API) and displays their details.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/rinki-yadav-2001/atars-war-heroes.git
2. cd atars-war-heroes/star-war

3. run command : npm install 
4. npm start 


## Cypress run

1. npm run cypress:open  OR npx cypress open  

Note : To run Cypress tests, make sure your application is running on http://localhost:3000/ 


## Challenge faced: 
To complete this task, I utilized resources from Google and sought assistance from ChatGPT for refining the syntax.
The most challenging aspects I have encountered are writing unit tests and declaring types.


## Improvements:
If I would have given more time, I would have made the following enhancements:

1. Loader and Styling: I could have implemented a loading spinner or loader for a better user experience. Additionally, I would have enhanced the styling to improve the overall visual appeal.

2. Accessibility: I would have focused on improving accessibility by ensuring the application is navigable and usable for individuals with disabilities. This includes adding appropriate ARIA attributes and ensuring a proper focus order.

3. Refined API Fetching: I would have explored methods to efficiently fetch arrays of API data separately, optimizing the application's performance.

## Thank you for the opportunity!
